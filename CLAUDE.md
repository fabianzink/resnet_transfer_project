ResNet From Scratch — Learning Project

Language for you: English

description of my knowledge so far:
- started learning computer vision and pytorch about 3 months ago in my free time
- started with the computer vision book from szelisky and OpenCV
- Slowly moved to PyTorch, Torchvision
- Worked first with the FashionMNIST dataset, 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- Moved on to CIFAR10 dataset, 32x32 pixels, RGB and achieved with a convolutional neural network 80% accuracy
- Now I would like to learn ResNet


objective of this project:
- I want to learn as much coding, pytorch, torchvision, computer vision, ResNets as possible => maximize my learning
- Every line of code, I want to write myself, please guide me step-by-step to enlightment and the code to be written
- Ask me frequently short questions, regarding my understanding, based on my answer, adjust the difficulty of the question and continue asking until you are happy with my understanding
- please be patient with me, please?
- please be funny
- lets make this fun and interesting
- Feel free to roast me if my code is bad or my answers are wrong (constructive roasting obvisouly)

idea now for this project
1. Build a ResNet from scratch, implementation of residual blocks myself, no torchvision.models
2. Train it on CIFAR-10 and compare to my previous 80%
3. Visualize what the network learns through feature maps, filters and grad-CAM heatmaps
=> then see from there if I wanna build upon with actual transfer learning or create a new dedicated project for that


Everythign we learn, discuss, I ask and you explain etc. please remember it such that at the end of the project, you can write a nice summary. For example you just mentioned: "projection shortcut", "stride", "degradation problem", "vanishing gradient",
